Future Iterations will include: 

## Bonus #1: Tracking Fishing
* As a user, I should be able to click something on each bear to indicate it has just tried to catch a fish.
* As a user, I should be able to click something on each bear to indicate it has just successfully caught a fish.
* As a user, looking at a bear card I should see time stamps and statuses for each time a bear caught a fish or attempted to catch a fish
* As a user, looking at a bear card, I should see a total number of fish caught tally.

## Bonus #2: Fattest Bear Award
Each year in early september one bear is awarded the Fattest Bear award.  This award goes to the bear who gains the most weight between July and September.  Create an awards section on your application and award GOLD to the bear who has eaten the most fish, SILVER to the bear with the second most eaten fish, and BRONZE to the bear with the third most eaten fish.  Where applicable your application should show two winners for an award if the number of fish is tied.
